      is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language like
      <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank"
      title="HTML wikipedia">HTML</a></strong>.
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
      including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
      and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
      Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
      present the same markup page in different styles for different
      rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
      (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
      devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
      is accessed on a mobile device.
